# font-maker

The easiest way to turn your custom fonts into files compatible with [MapLibre GL](https://maplibre.org) (and Mapbox GL too).

For other prepared fonts, look at [maplibre/demotiles/font](https://github.com/maplibre/demotiles/tree/gh-pages/font) instead.

## Usage

* Go to the web app at [protomaps.github.io/font-maker/](https://protomaps.github.io/font-maker/) and select your file.

* Wait for the progress bar to complete and download your ZIP containing all ranges for the font. 

## Installation

You don't need to install anything to create SDF fonts, just use the page above. 

For command line usage and developing, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Variants

By specifying a font file you can control which variants are used for these scripts:

* Cyriac (Eastern/Western/Estrangela)
* Han (kr/hk/cn/tw/jp/vn)
